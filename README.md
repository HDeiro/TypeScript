This repository contains some exercises, code snippets and concepts i'm learning while i'm learning TypeScript.

Some references i'm using for that:

* "TypeScript Fundamentals" (https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/typescript),
* "TypeScript in-depth" (https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-in-depth)
* "TypeScript Advanced" (http://app.pluralsight.com/courses/typescript-advanced).
